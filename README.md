I think this website is very fascinating. It's incredible how a single textbox can so profoundly change the social, cultural, and economic structure of our world. This website started as a dorm room coding project, and is now crucial to almost every industry in the modern world. It wouldn't be a stretch to say that the economic wellbeing of almost every country on Earth would be substantially impacted if this website were to suddenly vanish. I am also inspired by Google's efforts to continuously push the limits of artificial intelligence technology, particularly the work of our friends at Google Brain and DeepMind.
